# 5e-statblock-importer
Easily import monster and NPC statblocks into your game. As long as the statblock is formatted using the standard WotC layout, it'll create a new actor with an NPC character sheet using those stats.

## How to use
Once installed, you'll see a new button at the bottom of the characters tab that looks like this...

Clicking the button will open a window with a big text box that you can past the statblock into. Here's an example of a very simple one for a Frost Giant from the [SRD](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd).

After you've pasted it in, click the "Import" button and you'll see a new actor appear in the side panel.

Open the character sheet for that new actor and you'll see all of the stats and actions filled out for you.
