Stone Sacrifice (3/Day). When Emer fails a saving throw,
she can choose to succeed instead by ending the effects of her
Stone Gaze on a creature of her choice within 300 feet of her.
ACTIONS
Multiattack. Emer uses Pinning Shot or makes three attacks
using Snake Bite, Longbow, or both. She also uses Stone Gaze
or Envenomed Stone, if available.
Snake Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one creature. Hit: 17 (5d6) poison damage, and the target
must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be
poisoned until the end of Emer’s next turn. While poisoned
in this way, the target can’t take reactions.
Longbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, range
150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d8 + 7) piercing damage
plus 14 (4d6) poison damage.
Pinning Shot. Emer makes three Longbow attacks against a
creature touching the ground within 150 feet of her. If at least
two of those attacks hit, the target is restrained by arrows
pinning their limbs to the ground. A creature restrained in
this way or another creature who can reach them can use an
action to pull out the arrows and end the condition.
Stone Gaze. Emer fires beams of energy from her eyes at
up to three creatures she can see within 60 feet of her. Each
target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw
or begin turning to stone (save ends at end of turn). While
turning to stone, a creature’s speed is reduced by 10 feet
and they have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving
throws. If a creature who is turning to stone is targeted by this
action again and fails their save, their speed is reduced by
another 10 feet and they are dazed until the effect ends.
If a creature who is turning to stone and dazed in this way
is targeted by this action again and fails their save, they are
petrified and can no longer make saving throws to end the
effects of Stone Gaze. The petrification lasts until the creature
is restored by Emer’s Stone Sacrifice trait, a cure ailment
power of 4th order or higher, a greater restoration spell,
or a similar supernatural effect.
Envenomed Stone (Recharge 5–6). Emer utters an ancient
hex. Each creature within 60 feet of her who is being turned
to stone by her Stone Gaze must make a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) poison damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one.
BONUS ACTIONS
Mesmerizing Eyes. The glowing eyes of Emer’s snakes gaze
at one creature Emer can see within 60 feet of her. If the
target can see Emer, they must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw or be charmed until the start of the target’s next
turn. A target charmed in this way must immediately use their
reaction, if available, to move up to their speed in a direction
of Emer’s choice.
REACTIONS
Blinding Mucus. When a creature Emer can see within 5 feet
of her hits her with a melee attack, Emer spits venom at their
eyes. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw or take 7 (2d6) acid damage and be blinded until the
start of their next turn.
VILLAIN ACTIONS
Emer has three villain actions. She can take each action once
during an encounter after an enemy’s turn. She can take these
actions in any order but can use only one per round.
Action 1: I See You! Emer uses Stone Gaze against each
enemy she can see within 60 feet of her.
Action 2: Medusa’s Evolution. Emer grows wings from her
back, gaining a flying speed of 40 feet, then she moves
up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
After 1 minute, the wings crumble to dust and her flying
speed is lost.
Action 3: Stone Puppets. Emer mentally manipulates the
stone in each creature who is being turned to stone by her
Stone Gaze. Emer and each of those creatures move up to
their speed then make a weapon attack against a creature
of Emer’s choice (no action required).
