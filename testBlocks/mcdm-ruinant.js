Lethe. When the ruinant’s soul count is 0, they have adv antage
on attack rolls, disadvantage on saving throws, and their Intel-
ligence score becomes 3 (−4). Additionally, the ruinant must
use their movement on each of their turns to move as close
as possible to the nearest creature they can sense with their
soulsight, and then if they are able, they must use their action
to attack and attempt to kill that creature. The ruinant can’t act
with any other purpose until they add 1 to their soul count.
Soul Devourer. When the ruinant reduces a creature who isn’t
a Construct or an Undead to 0 hit points or deals damage to a
dying creature, the creature must make a DC 11 Wisdom sav-
ing throw. On a failed save, the ruinant consumes the creature’s
soul and adds 1 to the ruinant’s soul count. A creature whose
soul is consumed in this way immediately dies, and they can’t
be restored to life by any means short of a wish spell.
ACTIONS
Multiattack. The ruinant makes three Bloodletting
Claws attacks.
Bloodletting Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach
5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus
7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and the target can’t take reactions
this turn.
Salt Wounds (Costs 1 Soul). The ruinant chooses up to three
creatures they can see within 60 feet of them who don’t have
all their hit points. Each target must make a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
REACTIONS
Corrupt Healing (Costs 1 Soul). When a creature within
60 feet of the ruinant regains hit points from a power, a spell,
or a similar supernatural effect, the ruinant corrupts the effect.
The target regains no hit points, and the target and each of
the ruinant’s enemies within 5 feet of the ruinant must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take necrotic damage
equal to half the number of hit points the effect would
have restored.`;
