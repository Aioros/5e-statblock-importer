Envenom. Each ally within 30 feet of the hag deals an extra
3 (1d6) poison damage with weapon attacks, provided the
hag isn’t incapacitated.
ACTIONS
Multiattack. The hag makes one Poison Claw attack and uses
Granny Says.
Poison Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6)
poison damage.
Granny Says. The hag affects one other willing creature
they can see within 30 feet of them with one of the follow-
ing effects:
• The target magically switches places with the hag.
• The target uses their reaction, if available, to make an attack.
Naughty Mousey (3/Day; 5th-Level Spell; Concentration).
The hag chooses a creature they can see within 60 feet of
them and attempts to transform them into a Beast of the hag’s
choice with a challenge rating of 2 or lower. The target must
succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be transformed
for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). While transformed,
the target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the
chosen Beast, though they retain their alignment, personality,
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target’s
gear melds into the new form. They can’t activate, use, wield,
or otherwise benefit from any of their equipment. They can’t
speak or cast spells but can take any action the Beast can take.
If the target drops to 0 hit points while in this form, they revert
back to their original form with half the number of hit points
they had before they transformed.
REACTIONS
Get Gone. When an ally within 30 feet of the hag is targeted
with an attack, the hag can turn the target invisible until
the start of the target’s next turn, potentially imposing
disadvantage on the triggering attack roll and causing it to
miss. To use this reaction, the hag must be able to see the ally
and the attacker.
