ACTIONS

damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitu-
tion saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute (save ends at

Brittle Bone Hex (Cantrip). The cursespitter chooses one
creature they can see within 60 feet of them. The target’s
bones are wracked with pain until the end of their next turn.
The first time the target willingly moves or uses an action, a
bonus action, or a reaction before then, they must succeed
on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8)
necrotic damage.
To Me! The cursespitter chooses up to two willing crea-
tures they can see within 30 feet of them. Each creature
is teleported to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the
cursespitter.
Dizzying Hex (2/Day; 1st-Level Spell). The cursespitter

The target must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the target falls prone and can’t stand back up for
1 minute (save ends at end of turn).
REACTIONS
Cowardly Commander. When a creature the cursespitter
can see hits them with an attack, the cursespitter chooses
